Calculating Prime numbers using Scratch 1.4

2 methods for calculating Prime numbers using Scratch 1.4
For both the principle is the same that you onlf have to check if divisible by numbers up the the square root of the number being checked.
The BFI version does this by checking all odd numbers between 3 and SQR(Number being checked)

The List version adds new Prime numbers found to a List and only checks the Prime Numbers between 2 and the SQR(Number being checked) by reading the previously found Prime numbers from the list.

I've seen that Lists can slow down Scratch so I was very interested to see if the List management overhead was off set by doing fewer calculations.

For checking Primes in numbers up to 1000 the results were very similar.
When I check larger numbers I'll come back and update this file.
